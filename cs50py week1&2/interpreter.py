# In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

# x is an integer
# y is +, -, *, or /
# z is an integer
# For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

math_operation = input("Enter a math operation: ")
math_operation = math_operation.split(" ")
x = float(math_operation[0])
y = math_operation[1]
z = float(math_operation[2])

if y == "+":
    print(x + z)
elif y == "-":
    print(x - z)
elif y == "*":
    print(x * z)
elif y == "/":
    print(x / z)
